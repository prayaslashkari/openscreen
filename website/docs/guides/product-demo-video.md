# How to make a product demo video

To make a product demo video, write a short script, record the product at a steady pace, then edit: cut the dead time, zoom in on what matters, hide private data, add captions, and export in the shape your channel needs. This guide does each step in OpenScreen, a free, MIT-licensed screen recorder and editor for Windows, macOS and Linux, where recording, editing, transcription and export run on your machine. OpenScreen produces a video file. It does not host the video or build a clickable walkthrough; if you need either, see [When OpenScreen is not the right tool](#when-openscreen-is-not-the-right-tool).

## Before you start

- Install OpenScreen from the [download page](/download/). [Installation](../installation.md) covers each platform.
- Decide where the video will be watched. That decides the shape: 16:9 for a website or docs page, 9:16 for a vertical feed, 1:1 for a square slot.
- Prepare the product: a demo account, sample data, notifications off.

## 1. Write the script in the Notes window

On Windows and macOS, click **Open Notes** in the HUD. It opens a rich-text window that is saved locally between sessions. Write the script there, one action per line. The Linux HUD has no Notes button.

The Notes window doubles as a teleprompter. **Start auto-scroll** scrolls the text at a speed from 10 to 100. The font size goes from 14 to 48 px, and **Mirror horizontally** flips the text.

:::caution
On Windows, OpenScreen keeps the HUD and the Notes window out of the capture. On macOS it cannot guarantee that, so keep the Notes window on a display you are not recording. On macOS and Linux, use **Hide recording bar** if the HUD sits on the recorded screen.

## 2. Record the screen or a window

1. On Windows and macOS, open the source picker and choose a display under **Screens** or a single window under **Windows**. On macOS 15.2 and later, you choose the display or window in Apple's system picker instead. On Linux there is no in-app picker: the system portal asks for the source on every take. OpenScreen has no region capture, so record the window or the screen, then crop the clip in the editor.
2. Turn on the microphone and check its level meter. Turn on system audio if the product makes sound, and the webcam if you want to appear on screen.
3. Keep the editable cursor mode, the default: the pointer is recorded as data, so you can restyle it later. Clicks are recorded on Windows. On macOS they need the Accessibility permission. On Linux your user must be in the `input` group, and touchpad tap-to-click is not captured ([details](../installation.md#mouse-clicks-on-wayland)).
4. Press record. A 3-2-1 countdown runs first and cannot be turned off.

OpenScreen captures at a 60 fps target, up to 3840×2160 on Windows and macOS. On Linux the size is whatever the compositor hands over. While recording you can pause, restart the take, cancel it, or stop.

**Pace for the zooms.** Click where the action is, and let the result show before you move on. The automatic zooms in step 4 follow your clicks: clicks close together share one zoom when they fit in it together, and it holds for 1.5 seconds after the last one. The first 2.5 seconds of the video stay wide, so give the take a moment before the first click.

**Long demos on Linux.** Linux writes a regular MP4 that is only finalized when you stop, so a crash mid-take leaves an unreadable file. Record several shorter takes instead; step 5 shows how to join them.

See [Recording](../recording.md) for every HUD control.

## 3. Choose the webcam layout and background

The webcam is recorded to its own file, so its placement is an editing decision you can change at any time. Open the **Camera layout** facet in the editor's inspector:

- **Picture in picture**, **Vertical stack**, **Dual frame**, or **No webcam**.
- For every layout: mirror, and a crop of the camera image.
- For **Picture in picture** only: **Camera shape** (Rectangle or Square), **Roundness** (at 100% a square camera is a circle), a size from 15 to 50% (25% by default), **Position** (a corner or the middle of an edge, bottom right by default), and **Shrink on zoom**, on by default, which makes the camera smaller while a zoom plays so it does not cover the detail. Drag the camera on the canvas and it snaps to the nearest position.
- **Camera background**: Original, Blur, Cutout or Custom. Cutout removes the background without a green screen, using a segmentation model that runs on your CPU. This section only appears when the segmentation runtime loads on your machine.

For an intro or outro, press `C` to add a **Full Camera** segment: the camera fills the whole frame for that span.

The **Composition** facet styles the frame. Its background section offers 18 built-in wallpapers, a solid color, a gradient or your own image, an animation that moves gradients and images alike, and a background blur. Below it are shadow, padding, roundness and motion blur.

## 4. Add automatic zooms

OpenScreen adds them when the take opens in the editor: it reads the recorded clicks and zooms in on them, with no network and no model. If the take opened without them, open **Auto-enhance** in the timeline toolbar and choose **Automatic zooms**. If it places nothing, it tells you so. The usual causes are a recording without recorded clicks, clicks only in its first or last seconds, or existing zooms that already cover them or sit too close to them.

Then review them. Click a zoom to set its level (from 1.25× to 5×), its focus mode (Auto follows the cursor, Manual holds a fixed point) and an optional 3D camera. Press `Z` to add a zoom by hand, and `Ctrl/Cmd+D` to delete one you do not want.

More on how the zooms are placed: [Auto-zoom](/features/auto-zoom/).

## 5. Cut from the transcript and speed up dead time

**Transcribe first.** Open the **Transcript** facet. If no transcript is there yet, click **Transcribe now**. Transcription runs locally with Whisper. The first run downloads its model once, about 264 MB.

**Cut by text.** In the transcript, select words and press `Delete`: that span is cut from playback and from the export. Silences show up inline as markers: click one to cut it, and click it again to restore it. Hover a cut word to restore it. You can also press `T` to add a trim region on the timeline.

**Speed up what you cannot cut**, such as page loads or typing. Press `S` to add a speed region, pick a preset (0.5×, 1×, 1.5×, 2× or 4×), or type any value from 0.25× to 16×. The audio is time-stretched to match.

**Join several takes.** Switch to **Media**, use **Import media** if a take is not listed yet, then drag its card onto the clip row. Dropped on an existing clip, it offers **Add before**, **Add after** or **Split here and insert**. See [Media library](../media-library.md).

If you have connected your own LLM provider, **Auto-enhance → Smart cuts** hands the cutting to the AI agent. It is optional and off until you add a key ([AI editing](../ai-editing.md)). Undo keeps the last 50 steps, agent edits included.

## 6. Blur private data, annotate, add sound

Press `A` to add an annotation, then pick its **Type**:

- **Blur**: Smooth or Mosaic, rectangle or oval. Place it over emails, API keys or customer names, stretch its region over every frame that shows them, then scrub through to check.
- **Text**: with an optional animation (Fade, Rise, Pop, Slide Left, Typewriter or Pulse).
- **Arrow**: eight directions, adjustable stroke width and color.
- **Image**: a JPG, PNG, GIF or WebP, such as a logo.

For sound, press `V` to record a voice-over on the timeline, or `M` to import music (mp3, wav, m4a, aac, flac, ogg, opus). Each track has its own gain, fades, loop and mute.

The **Cursor** facet restyles the pointer from step 2. Every tool is listed in [Editing & timeline](../editing-timeline.md).

## 7. Burn in captions

In the **Transcript** facet, click **Captions** and turn on **Show captions**. They are drawn live from the transcript, so the cuts from step 5 carry over with no extra step. Set the font, size, bold, color, background plate, position, and 1 to 12 words per line. Check the placement in the preview after any change of shape.

Whisper detects the spoken language, or you can force one of 100 languages with **Regenerate as** in the Media stage. To publish in another language, **Translate** into one of 15 targets and select that language under **Display** before exporting. Translation goes through your own LLM provider, so it needs a key.

Captions are burned into the video. OpenScreen does not write an `.srt` or `.vtt` file, so a player cannot turn them off. Details: [Captions & transcript](../captions.md), and [how the captions feature works](/features/captions/).

## 8. Export

**Pick the shape.** The **Format** control in the **Composition** facet offers **Auto** (the default for new projects), which fits the frame to your recording, camera layout and padding, then 16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:3, 4:5, 16:10, 10:16, or the original shape of your clips.

**Export.** Click **Export** in the top bar:

- **MP4**: 720p, 1080p or Source; 24, 30 or 60 fps; H.264. The video bitrate is not adjustable, about 8 Mbit/s at 1080p.
- **GIF**: 15, 20, 25 or 30 fps; Medium, Large or Original size; loop on or off. GIFs use 256 colors without dithering, so they suit short clips of flat interface.

There is no watermark. To export another shape, change the format and export again.

**Keep the project.** Save it with `Ctrl/Cmd+S` as an `.openscreen` file, so you can swap a clip and export again when the interface changes. It references your media rather than embedding it; `openscreen pack` gathers everything into one portable folder ([CLI](/docs/cli/)). More in [Export](../export.md).

## Publish the file

OpenScreen does not host your video, create share links or count views. Upload the exported file wherever your audience watches it.

## When OpenScreen is not the right tool

- **You want a hosted link with viewer analytics or comments.** A hosted recorder fits better. Loom, for example, shares each recording as a link on loom.com, and its pricing page lists viewer insights and video comments on every plan (as of September 2026). See [OpenScreen as a Loom alternative](/alternatives/loom/) for the narrower case where OpenScreen does fit.
- **You want an interactive demo** that the viewer clicks through. OpenScreen exports video and GIF only.
- **Your video player needs a separate caption file.** OpenScreen only burns captions in.
- **You record on a phone or tablet.** OpenScreen is a desktop app for Windows, macOS 13 or later, and Linux.
