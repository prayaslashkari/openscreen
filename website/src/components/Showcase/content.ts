/**
 * Everything the page says after the editor has finished demonstrating itself.
 *
 * The scroll-driven editor above this section is where the product is argued:
 * six settings, shown working, on a real project file. That leaves this section
 * a narrower job — the parts of the app the editor is not — and there are four
 * of them: the recorder in front of it, the encoder behind it, and the two
 * features that are easier to show than to describe.
 *
 * All four now get a picture, which reverses the split this file used to carry.
 * The old argument was that a screenshot of a format dropdown proves nothing a
 * sentence does not and costs a request to say it. That argument was about
 * screenshots. These four panels are drawn in DOM: they cost no photograph and
 * no second request, they re-render in the page's own typeface and swap with
 * the theme, and they cannot go stale against a repaint of the application the
 * way a plate shot on one build does. The reason to withhold a picture was its
 * price; the price is gone.
 *
 * What has not changed is that the copy has to stand on its own. Every panel
 * here is a drawing, it is labelled as one, and nothing in this section asks to
 * be believed on the strength of it. The specification line under each claim is
 * still doing the work.
